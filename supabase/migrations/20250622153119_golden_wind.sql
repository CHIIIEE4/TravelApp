  # Storage Setup for Tweet Images

  1. Storage Bucket
    - Create `tweet-images` bucket for storing user uploaded images
    - Set 10MB file size limit
    - Allow common image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
    - Enable public access for viewing images

  2. Security Policies
    - Users can upload images to their own folder
    - Public read access for all tweet images
    - Users can delete/update their own images only
    - Folder-based access control using user ID
